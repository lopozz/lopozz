We created this toy example for people to get familiar with local LLMs and give the possibility to recreate a user experience similar to commercial solutions. To use the notebook simply follow these steps:
1. create a vitual environemnt (NB: you need python installed). From the directory of the project, launch this command in the terminal:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
2. activate the environemnet to start installing all the needed packages. From the terminal launch this command:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
3. install the list of needed packages from the ```requirements.txt``` (more details about this standard [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/))
```
pip install -r path-to-file/requirements.txt
```
4. DONE! Now you are ready to use the notebook. Just run it cell by cell until the end.
